Javascript Tetris
=================

An adaptive implementation of [Jake Gordon's Javascript Tetris](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris) designed for research on flow experience.
Available in three versions:
* balance: designed to adapt in difficulty to a player's skill to enable a flow experience
* overload: designed to be too hard to elicit flow
* boredom: designed to be too easy to elicit flow
Downloads some performance metrics after time limit is reached.

Note: This implementation is neither elegant nor efficient because I am very much not a JS developer; you might be better off creating your own.

Should work in all browser with ES6 support.
